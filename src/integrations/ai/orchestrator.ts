Task: Generate a comprehensive medical assessment in strict JSON format with:

1. results: Array of up to 3 most likely conditions, each with:
   - condition: specific medical condition name
   - confidence: numerical score 0-100 based on evidence strength
   - severity: "low", "medium", or "high" based on urgency and potential complications
   - evidence: array of specific clinical findings supporting this diagnosis
   - recommendations: array of specific, actionable medical recommendations (diagnostic tests, treatments, referrals, lifestyle modifications)
   - source: which agent provided strongest evidence

2. consensus: Overall diagnostic consensus with:
   - primaryDiagnosis: most likely condition based on all evidence
   - confidence: overall confidence 0-100
   - alternativeDiagnoses: array of alternative diagnoses to consider

Guidelines for recommendations:
- Include specific diagnostic tests (lab work, imaging, procedures)
- Suggest appropriate specialist referrals when indicated
- Recommend immediate vs routine follow-up based on severity
- Include patient education and lifestyle modifications
- Consider medication management when appropriate
- Address symptom management and monitoring
